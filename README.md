Rational Synergy/Change scripts

The perl folder contains an example PM which has a few methods that proivde some useful synegry functions.  It's main aim though is to show how to use the CSAPI to dump CR attachments.

The CLI folder has a demo script which shows you how to do the same thing from the Linux CLI.  It does NOT use the CSAPI, but uses the CLI synergy interface.

In the end, most of my heavy-lifting was done from the CLI end, as it's more completley implemented, or was at the time.
